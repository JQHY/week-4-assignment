        <h1>Using AI in Medicine</h1>
        <p>Modern medicine benefits greatly from the increased use of artificial intelligence for the diganosis and treatment of patients</p>
        <p>It's currently being used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moniter and predict the spread of breast cancer.</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>Not all breast cancers are agressive, and it's often difficult for doctors to predict how a stage 0 cancer will grow, but by using AI they can spot patterns. This then helps doctors choice the right treatment for individual patients.

                </ul>
            <li>Design protein that can protect lab grown human cells against Covid-19. </li>
                <ul>
                    <p>Coronaviruses latch onto human cells, using "Spike proteins" enabling the virus to infect the person. Computers have been used to originate new proteins that bind to the Spike protein, obstructing it from infecting cells, the develeopment of this drug could lead to treatment or even prevention of infection.

                <ul>
                    <p>Researchers have used 3D printers to create patient-specific heart valves to help doctors understand the exact structure of the patients heart. This often means doctors don't have to perform open heart surgery and can find a less invasive procdure.
