        <p style="margin: 10px;">The justice system including the police force have been trying to increase their efficiency for many decades. With the 
          rise of technology; there has been a steady increase creating innovative software and machinery to assist the system. 
          Here are a few innovative technologies used by the police force today...

        <p style="margin: 10px;">
          This is one of the more controversial emerging technologies used to find and track potential susepects by running images through a very
          complex system called facial recognition software. Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive
          details about a person's face. These details, such as distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical
          representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database. Though advanced forms of facial recognition 
          offer “dazzling potential for crime prevention” (for example, tracking wanted criminals, missing people and suspected terrorists), 
          the report cautions that it is also “raising alarms” about the potential for mistakes and abuse since it could be used to secretly 
          monitor the public.

        <p style="margin: 10px;">
          Police have been using fingerprints to identify people for over a century. Now, in addition to facial recognition and DNA, there
          is an ever-expanding array of biometric (and behavioral) characteristics to being utilized by law enforcement and the intelligence 
          community. These include voice recognition, palmprints, wrist veins, iris recognition, gait analysis and even heartbeats. We all have
          unique biometric characteristics which is why this is so effective and now that it has been digitalised - the accuracy and the
          efficiency has increased substantially. With comprehensive electronic databases; fingerprints can be taken remotely and an identity
          can be revealed in under 60 seconds - which makes biometrics a very reliable technology.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;color:white ;background-color: grey; width: 100%;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, 
        sans-serif, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 25px; margin: 10px;">Robots</h3>
        <p style="margin: 10px;">
          Many law enforcement agencies are now using next-generation robotic cameras to deliver visual and audio surveillance of potential 
          crime scenes that may be too dangerous or too hard for officers to reach.
          Some of these devices are even “throwable” (up to 120 feet and capable of withstanding repeated 30-foot drops) — powered by an 
          electric motor and equipped with high-tech wheels that enable it to move, climb and explore even the most challenging spaces while 
          being operated wirelessly by a trained officer. Robots come in all forms and are the next generation of technologies which are set
          to emerge in the law enforcement system.
